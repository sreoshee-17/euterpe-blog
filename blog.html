 <h3>The Seven Coats</h3>
 <p> After a spell in which he composed little, Satie entered Paris's second music academy, 
the Schola Cantorum, as a mature student. His studies there were more successful than those at the 
Conservatoire. From about 1910 he became the focus of successive groups of young composers 
attracted by his unconventionality and originality. Among them were the group known as Les Six. A 
meeting with Jean Cocteau in 1915 led to the creation of the ballet Parade (1917) for Serge Diaghilev, 
with music by Satie, sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso and choreography by Léonide Massine.</p>

 <h3>Of Cats and Curses</h3>
 <p> The Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami is a novel steeped in other-wordly 
sequences, some macabre, some dreamlike but all haunting. The novel unfurls in two parallel 
narratives, seemingly disparate in the beginning but seamlessly spliced in the end. The odd numbered 
chapters tell the story of 15 year old Kafka Tamura, who, in the company of his alter-ego, Crow, runs 
away from his father’s house to either escape an Oedipal curse or to search for his long lost mother 
and sister. He eventually finds his way to a library in Takamatsu, run by Miss Saeki and an 
androgynous hemophiliac Oshima. The even-numbered chapters tell Nakata’s story, who as he often 
says is ‘not so bright’. </p>

 <h3>The Silent Child</h3>
 <p> The Silent Child, by Chris Overton, doesn’t compromise on soul for didacticism. The 
screenplay, by Rachel Shenton, who also stars in the film as Joanne, is neither fleet-footed nor 
tortuous, it is a balanced narrative that steadily progresses. Maisley Sly as Libby, Rachel Fielding as 
Sue and Shenton as Jo, are stellar. The film is set in rural England. The foggy exteriors give off a 
sense of ineptitude — Libby’s deafness and her family’s inability to commiserate. The plot is 
impactful, the narrative linear. Jo, a social worker, is appointed by Libby’s family to help her face 
school as a specially abled child. Jo teaches Libby British sign-language and they quickly bond over 
a montage of jaunts.</p>
